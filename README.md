Through the agent based model, I will build a spread model for the city of Bern during the COVID-19 period.

Tasks for the project:
1. Using Network analysis to find the main stations in the City of Bern, and create a raster data for them;
2. Built the agent based model for simulating the spread in Bern;
3. Validate this model.

Week 10 (07.05): Network analysis for the station data;
Week 11 (14.05): Built ABM;
Week 12 (21.05): Built ABM;
Week 13 (28.05): Validation the model;
