Through the agent based model, I will build a spread model for the city of Bern during the COVID-19 period.

Tasks for the project:
1. Using Network analysis to find the main stations in the City of Bern, and create a raster data for them;
2. BUilt the agent based model for simulating the spread in Bern;
3. Validate this model.
